This directory contains automated tests of DFTRES.

To run the tests, execute
# 'sh test.sh [--dft dftcalc] [--dft storm] [--] [options]'
where [options] is a list of options accepted by DFTRES (e.g. --zvav or
-n 10000).

The tests are listed in 'tests.txt', formatted as:
	filename	"options"	reference_result
where the options should specify the metric to calculate, and the
reference result should be an interval known to contain the true value.

Tests that are expected to fail are lister in 'expect-fail.txt',
formatted as:
	filename	[+|!]"condition1" [+|!]"condition2" ...
where +"condition" means that the test is expected to fail if
"condition" is an option on the DFTRES commandline, while !"condition"
means the test is expected to fail if the condition is not given as an
option to DFTRES. Conditions can be mixed arbitrarily, and test is
expected to fail is all conditions match.

If '--dft dftcalc' and/or '--dft storm' is included, the tests in
'dfttests.txt' are also performed. These are .dft files which require
DFTCalc and/or Storm-DFT to run.

Tests are performed using a static seed and four threads, so they should
be reproducible.
